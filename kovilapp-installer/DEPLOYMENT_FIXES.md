# Kovil App Installer v1.4.0 - Deployment Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Config.php Template Issues**
**Problem**: The `modern/config.php` template file contained hardcoded paths that assumed the application would remain in `/kovilapp/modern/` subfolder.

**Solution**: 
- Updated the template config.php to use dynamic path detection suitable for root deployment
- Changed hardcoded paths like `/kovilapp/modern` to use `$_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']`
- All path variables now point to document root after installation

### 2. **Installation Order Issues**
**Problem**: The installer was creating config.php before moving files, which could result in the template config.php overwriting the generated one.

**Solution**:
- Reordered installation steps: files are moved first, then config.php is generated
- This ensures the generated config.php (with correct database settings) is always the final version

### 3. **File Copy Conflicts**
**Problem**: The recursive copy function could overwrite the generated config.php with the template version.

**Solution**:
- Added explicit exclusion for `config.php` in the file copy process
- The installer now skips copying `config.php` from the template, ensuring only the generated version exists

### 4. **Path Generation Improvements**
**Problem**: Complex path calculations in config generation could fail in different hosting environments.

**Solution**:
- Simplified path detection logic
- Use direct `$_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']` references
- Removed complex path manipulation that could break in different environments

## Installation Flow (v1.4.0)

1. **System Requirements Check**
2. **File Permissions Check** 
3. **Directory Creation**
4. **Database Setup** (create database, import schema, create admin user)
5. **File Deployment** (copy all files from `modern/` to web root, excluding config.php)
6. **Configuration Generation** (create config.php with correct database settings and paths)
7. **Final Checks**

## Key Changes Made

### In `install.php`:
- Reordered steps 5 and 6 (file deployment before config generation)
- Added config.php exclusion in `recursiveCopy()` method
- Improved path generation in `generateConfigFile()`

### In `modern/config.php`:
- Replaced hardcoded paths with dynamic detection
- Changed `/kovilapp/modern` references to document root
- Updated all path variables to work from web root

### In diagnostic tools:
- Enhanced `db_check.php` for database troubleshooting
- Updated `fix_config.php` with better path repair logic
- Added comprehensive troubleshooting documentation

## Deployment Result

After installation with v1.4.0:
- All application files are deployed to web root (not subfolder)
- Config.php contains correct paths pointing to document root
- Application accessible at `https://yourdomain.com/` (not `/kovilapp/modern/`)
- Database connection uses user-specified database name
- No hardcoded path references remain

## Troubleshooting Tools

If issues persist after installation:
- **`db_check.php`**: Diagnose database connection and table issues
- **`fix_config.php`**: Repair configuration path problems
- **`debug.php`**: Display PHP errors and environment information
